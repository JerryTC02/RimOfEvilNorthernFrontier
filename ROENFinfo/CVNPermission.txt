Q: can we use or rerelease this mod/assets from this mod?
A: absolutely not without CVN permission, you ask and wait. and yes this includes any form of reuse, even tracing or training. permission from CVN is required before using it for anything

submods that require the original are completely fine however, these include translations, balance patchs, whatever
asking is polite however, it feels nice to know people wanna add on to the mod
